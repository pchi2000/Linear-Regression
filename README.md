# Linear-Regression
Predicts what the peak electricity demand will be during the day tomorrow for some area (weâ€™ll consider data from the area surrounding Pittsburgh, PA). 
This is accomplished by using a simple linear regression algorithm implemented in Python on a Jupyter Notebook.

The notebook contains two implementaions, one using gradient descent and another, simpler analytical solution.

Additionally, the repository contains all data files used. These are stored in the Data Files folder.
